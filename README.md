## Overview

**myChatbot** is an exploratory project for building a basic chatbot and experimenting with generalization in conversational agents. It is implemented as Jupyter notebooks, making it easy to run step-by-step, tweak models, and visualize results.

## Features

- Interactive chatbot demo in `chatbot_demo.ipynb`  
- Generalization experiments in `generalizing_chatbot.ipynb`  
- Clean, incremental development and documentation  
- Easy to extend with new models, datasets, or architectures

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+  
- Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab  
- Common ML / NLP libraries (e.g. `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow` or `torch`)  
- (Optional) GPU support if you plan to train larger models

You can install necessary dependencies via `pip`. For example:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn jupyter
# plus your preferred deep learning library, e.g. torch or tensorflow 
```


### Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arthurmakumbi/myChatbot.git
cd myChatbot
```

(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If a requirements.txt file is not present, manually install the libraries you need (see ‚ÄúPrerequisites‚Äù).


### Running the Demo

Open Jupyter and run:

```bash jupyter notebook
```

Then open chatbot_demo.ipynb and run the cells in order. The notebook guides you through:
Data prep
Model training
Conversational interaction

You can similarly explore generalizing_chatbot.ipynb for experiments in generalizing across contexts or domains.

## Project Structure

```kotlin
myChatbot/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chatbot_demo.ipynb
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generalizing_chatbot.ipynb
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md        ‚Üê (this file)
```

- chatbot_demo.ipynb: The main demo notebook.
- generalizing_chatbot.ipynb: Experiments around generalization.
- .gitignore: Standard ignore file for Python / notebook artifacts.

## Usage

Use the demo notebook as a base to understand the flow of building a conversational agent.
Modify or extend training data, model architectures, or hyperparameters.
Add support for new conversational domains, datasets, or features (e.g. sentiment, context tracking).
Compare baseline models versus more advanced ones (Transformer-based, retrieval + generation, etc.).

## Customization
You can tailor this project by:
Replacing or augmenting training data
Swapping in neural network models (e.g. using transformers)
Adding modular pipeline steps (e.g. preprocessing, tokenization)
Integrating APIs (dialogue management, external knowledge bases)
Packaging into a web UI (Flask, FastAPI, etc.)
